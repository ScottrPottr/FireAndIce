# FireAndIce

This is a simple offline enabled application which shows a splash screen to load initial data, and then displays scrollable lists of data. Pull to refresh to reload initial data.

The application architecture was largely based off of the CLEAN architecture in Android example seen here: https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture
